I have used mobilenet ssd(caffe model) for human detection using the opencv dnn module with is the latest integration in the recent version for opencv. It requires opencv>=3.1.0 with contrib_modules and will work with opencv==3.3.0 without the contrib module.

For gender detection I have used a trained caffe model.

MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel 	 : SSD model for human detection(trained on Pascal VOC)

gender_detection.py 			 : used to find gender of the person

requirements.txt				 : additional python modules


Assumptions : 

	- the camera is able to capture the whole human being in a single frame
	- the average height of human beings is : 168cm
	- triangle equlity is valid : actual_distance = (actual_width*focal_length)/pixel_width_in_image

To run:
	python object_detection_dnn_cv.py
